<p>We started off at <a href="http://www.kusp.org">KUSP</a> in 1998, but recently KUSP has been struggling to stay open. We now produce GeekSpeak independently and could use your help to keep making our show.</p>

<p>If you are in the lookout for a good hosting company, we host at:
<ul><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d93b2b9fa332">Digital Ocean</a>. If you need hosting services then please use our <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d93b2b9fa332">Digital Ocean Referral Link</a>. You will get $10 off, and we will get $25 to cover our hosting costs.</li></ul>

<h2>Re-broadcast GeekSpeak</h2>
<p>If you are working on traditional radio and feel GeekSpeak might be a fit for your audience, please do <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to see if we might be able to work together.</p>
<p>Our show is Creative Commons, so you can re-use our stuff any way you like as long as you give us attribution. But working together we might be able to fit into your schedule even better.</p>
